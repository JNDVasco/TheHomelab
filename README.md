# TheHomelab

The last homelab revision before I decide this one isn't good enough and make another last revision.
Hopefully this time with less hardcode and leaked credentials

## Main Highlights
- Credential and secret managed by [HCP Vault Secrets](https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/vault-secrets)
- Focus even more on reproducibility i.e more focus on Infrastructure as Code with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and automation with scrips and [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)
